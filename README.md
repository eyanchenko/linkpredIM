# linkpredIM

This repository houses the code for "Link prediction for ex ante influence maximization on temporal networks" by Eric Yanchenko, Tsuyoshi Murata and Petter Holme. Please cite the paper if you used our methods. Happy coding! https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09965

There are five main parts of this respository.

1. Code for simulating diffusion process / IM algorithms
2. Code for JC link prediction
3. Code for LogReg link prediction
4. Code for NMF link prediction
5. Code for GNN link prediction

Please refer to the paper for further details on each method.
